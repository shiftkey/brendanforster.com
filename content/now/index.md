title: What I'm Doing Now
---

If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again I'll update this.

## Life stuff

 - Getting back into bouldering after a long hiatus, but recurring back injuries have made it a slow process.
 - Keen to get back into the outdoor life now that we're unofficially through winter.
 - Mentoring a couple of earlier-career peers, supporting them to navigate changes and help with goal-setting and career growth.

## Side Projects

Whatever open source stuff you may know me from is very much on a "as I feel like it" basis. 

This is a long story for another time but I'm very much worn out from this work and am not really using this stuff, so I don't feel the urge to work on it these days.
