title: What I'm Doing Now
---

If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again I'll update this.

## Where?

Currently up in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

## Upcoming Conferences

None planned. Life changes and being sick of long-haul travel.

## Side Projects

I had a bunch of life and work changes in 2019 which mean I'm now re-evaluating
what this means for the open source projects that I currently maintain.

If you're waiting for me to look at something, it's probably not going to happen
in a hurry. Sorry.

I might start some new fun projects to scratch some new itches, but nothing
serious planned.

## I want to get in touch!

My contact details are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/shiftkey/).

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shiftkey), if that's your scene.
