title: What I'm Doing Now
---

If you're not familiar with the whole [/now](http://nownownow.com/) thing,
have a look. TL;DR: this is a quick way for me to write up what I'm currently
up to. Every now and again I'll update this.

## Where?

Currently in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

## Upcoming Conferences

None planned. Life changes and still sick of long-haul travel.

## Side Projects

Whatever open source stuff you may know me from is very much on a "as I feel like it" basis. This is a long story for another time but I'm very much worn out from this work and am not really using this stuff, so I don't feel the urge to work on it these days.

## Non-side projects

Getting back into bouldering after a long hiatus, but recurring back injuries are meaning it's a slow process.
