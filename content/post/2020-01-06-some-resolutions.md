title: Some Resolutions for 2020
date: 2020-01-06
summary: Writing up some words so that I can refer back to them later.

I've been on holidays and after the delays, the chaos of Christmas with my
family and some downtime at the beach for New Years I've finally had a chance
to reflect on what I want to do in 2020.

There's definitely a theme of reflection in the goals I've set, and it's
probably because 2019 was a bit of a blur. I've also included some tangible
goals to verify the goal (a habit from the new team I've been working with).

## Re-evaluate my relationship with social media

Twitter has been my primary social network for many years, and I felt that 2019
was a point where I started to noticeably feel that I didn't get value from the
platform relative to the time spent there.

I thought about just burning my account to the ground a couple of time last
year, but without an alternative way to keep in touch with friends there I
paused that idea.

I disabled notifications on my phone for most of my apps a few years ago (that's
a rant for another time) to reduce distractions, which helped greatly back then,
but I'm going to experiment with two changes to how I use Twitter to see how it
affects my habits:

 - email notification for DM and notification *only*
 - remove the Twitter app from my phone

I'm also on Facebook and Instagram but those are not my primary hangouts. I keep
them around to keep in contact with specific people. If they were easily
accessible elsewhere, my need to use them would be significantly reduced.

**Success criteria:** a better understanding of whether I need
Twitter/Facebook/Instagram at all, whether I can move to alternatives and keep
in touch with those I care about, or clarity over how much time I can waste
there.

## Write More Often

Related to the previous point, I often use Twitter as an ephermeral channel
for things that could be blog posts. I've also set my Twitter account to
[delete old messages](https://tweetdelete.net/), so I really shouldn't put
anything important up there.

I did make a start on some new posts in 2019 around side projects, a couple of
which were published, but most of them sit in the drafts because they were too
long and needed editing work.

**Success criteria:** 20 new posts somewhere on this site (does this count as
the first one?)

## Maintain the Bullet Journal habit

I wasn't happy with how I was organizing myself, and felt there was a gap
between calendars, emails and notes that could be used. I'd also been following
the [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) project and been craving some
excuses for pen-and-paper work.

In July I'd setup a new book for BuJo (as the cool kids say) and stuck to
journalling for a couple of months, but I didn't keep up the habit as I'd leave
it in my bag and forget to keep it handy and up to date. One attempt to
"backfill" in September to catch up helped a bit, but then I fell away again
a couple of weeks after and didn't bother again.

I've definitely missed having it around to fill out and refer back to as the
end of the year got busier, so I think declaring "bankruptcy", finding some new
pens to use and restarting with a bit more discipline will help.

**Success criteria:** a completed Moleskine book or 12 months of Bullet Journal
activity, whichever comes first.

## Re-evaluate my relationship with open source

My work situation suddenly changed in the middle of the year in a way that
affected my time available for open source contributons. I moved away from being
active in the Electron ecosystem to focus on some internal engineering projects
at GitHub, which was a lot of fun but many days full of meetings meant that
evenings were not spent on anything computer-related, which was great to keep
that work-life balance healthy.

The downside of this is that several open source projects - that are either
solely maintained by me, or I'm a significant contributor to - have been
neglected.

I've been involved with open source in various forms for years, so the ebbs and
flows of things are familiar to me, but this situation feels different because
I don't miss the grunt work of maintaining projects, and my day work involves
different technologies - so I don't have bandwidth with.

**Success criteria:** clarity about my relationship with open source, and
leaving the current projects in a better state than they were at the start of
the year.

## Build some silly things

Having said all that, with learning Ruby on Rails I have enjoyed building some
silly things along the way to show I understand the concepts and tackle some
real-life problems I have. An example of this is [`shiftkey/webhooks`](https://github.com/shiftkey/webhooks) which consumes webhook events from GitHub and does some work that I would
previously do manually.

**Success criteria:** two new projects live on Heroku and in use that leverage
Ruby and do something useful to me.
